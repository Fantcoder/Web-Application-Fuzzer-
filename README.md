# Web Application Fuzzer

A Python-based web application security testing tool designed to help identify vulnerabilities through automated fuzzing techniques.

## Overview

This Web Application Fuzzer is a security testing tool that helps penetration testers and security researchers identify potential vulnerabilities in web applications by systematically submitting various malformed inputs and analyzing the responses.

## Features

- Web form fuzzing
- Parameter manipulation
- Common vulnerability testing
- Response analysis
- Customizable payloads
- Python-powered automation

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (install via pip):
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fantcoder/Web-Application-Fuzzer-.git
   cd Web-Application-Fuzzer-
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

```bash
python fuzzer.py -u <target_url> [options]
```

### Basic Options:
- `-u, --url`: Target URL to fuzz
- `-m, --method`: HTTP method (GET/POST)
- `-p, --payload`: Custom payload file
- `-o, --output`: Output file for results

## Security Considerations

- Always obtain proper authorization before testing any web application
- Use responsibly and only on applications you have permission to test
- Follow ethical hacking practices and respect privacy policies
