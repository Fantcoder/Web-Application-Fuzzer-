# Web Application Fuzzer

A Python-based web application security testing tool designed to help identify vulnerabilities through automated fuzzing techniques.

## Overview

This Web Application Fuzzer is a security testing tool that helps penetration testers and security researchers identify potential vulnerabilities in web applications by systematically submitting various malformed inputs and analyzing the responses.

## Features

- Advanced Web Form Fuzzing
  - Input field detection and automated testing
  - Support for multiple form types (login, search, upload, etc.)
  - Custom fuzzing patterns and payloads  

- Comprehensive Parameter Manipulation
  - URL parameter fuzzing
  - POST data manipulation
  - Cookie and header fuzzing
  - JSON/XML payload testing  

- Vulnerability Testing Capabilities
  - SQL Injection detection
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) testing
  - Command Injection checks
  - Directory Traversal testing
  - CSRF token analysis  

- Intelligent Response Analysis
  - Status code monitoring
  - Response time analysis
  - Error message detection
  - Pattern matching
  - Anomaly detection

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages:
  ```bash
  requests>=2.28.0
  beautifulsoup4>=4.9.3
  urllib3>=1.26.0
  argparse>=1.4.0

  ```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fantcoder/Web-Application-Fuzzer-.git
   cd Web-Application-Fuzzer-
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python fuzzer.py -u <target_url> [options]
```

### Common Use Cases

1. Basic Form Fuzzing:
```bash
python fuzzer.py -u https://example.com/login -m POST --form
```

2. Custom Payload Testing:
```bash
python fuzzer.py -u https://example.com/search -p payloads/xss.txt --output results.txt
```

3. Advanced Scanning with All Options:
```bash
python fuzzer.py -u https://example.com/api \
    --method POST \
    --headers "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --cookies "session=test" \
    --depth 3 \
    --timeout 30 \
    --threads 5 \
    --output scan_results.json
```

4. Parameter Discovery Mode:
```bash
python fuzzer.py -u https://example.com --discover --wordlist common-params.txt
```

### Available Options:
- `-u, --url`: Target URL to fuzz
- `-m, --method`: HTTP method (GET/POST)
- `-p, --payload`: Custom payload file
- `-o, --output`: Output file for results
- `--headers`: Custom HTTP headers
- `--cookies`: Cookie values
- `--depth`: Crawling depth
- `--timeout`: Request timeout
- `--threads`: Number of concurrent threads
- `--discover`: Enable parameter discovery mode
- `--verbose`: Enable detailed output

## Security Considerations

- Always obtain proper authorization before testing any web application
- Use responsibly and only on applications you have permission to test
- Follow ethical hacking practices and respect privacy policies
